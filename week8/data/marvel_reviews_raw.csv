Ant-Man and The Wasp,87%,"Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas","Did Marvel do it again? Yes. While not as kinetically moving as Winter Soldier or dramatically pleasing as Civil War, Ant Man and the Wasp gives audiences an extra scoop of ice cream in their escape from the summer heat."
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87%,"Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas","It's a light, screwball comedy that fully gives in to the ridiculous nature of its premise."

Ant-Man and The Wasp,87%,"Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas","It might not be the most memorable Marvel movie, but is a fun family outing for July 4th weekend, not to mention a lighthearted reprieve from the gut punch of ""Infinity War"" (damn you, Thanos)."

Ant-Man and The Wasp,87%,"Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas","[A] Saturday morning cartoon stretched out to feature length, for better and for worse."
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87%,"Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas","With a plot that at times is a bit wishy-washy, it's a sequel that appears to be a shrinking violet, a solid stand-alone that provides as much fun as its Marvel parent arms of the Universe."
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87%,"Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas","Ant-Man and the Wasp feels a bit like three underdeveloped stories playing all at the same time, none of them particularly tense or emotionally gripping"
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87%,"Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas",The Ant-Man movies are different entities from their MCU counterparts. These are the films that give us the human side of what's going on in this vast movie universe.
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87%,"Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas","I don't see the supposed entertainment, I am not excited by any scene, the characters are disposable, it is a childish one with a plot full of quantum gaps. [Full review in Spanish]"
Ant-Man and The Wasp,87%,"Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas","Marvel's final film of 2018 will probably be something of a relief to many fans of its superhero movies, if for no other reason than it's a fairly straightforward action-comedy that hits far more often than it doesn't."
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","If you're a big fan of the ever-expanding Marvel cinematic universe, you'll love the addition of Ant-Man to the mix.

Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","A really fun heist film with a sci-fi twist that has plenty of heart to go along with the humour, it's just a shame that the antagonist side of things is rather dull..."
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","Provides Humor & Heart, But It's No Marvel"

Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","For a film about an extremely small superhero, it contains some very large plot holes."
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","It's not horribly bad because I've seen worse. However it doesn't do anything special to really set it apart from other comic book films. In the end, it can be a bit forgettable."
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","The performances of the main cast, the refreshing display of Ant-Man's abilities, Michael Pena's superb comedic role, and a weird yet dynamic finale make this a superhero blockbuster worth checking out."
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","Ant-Man is a rousing, funny and exciting adventure, much along the same lines as Guardians of the Galaxy."
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","All in all, 'Ant-Man' is a great little entertainment that works wonderfully as the movie it wants to be, although it's obviously very different from what Edgar Wright could have offered us. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly",I thought this movie was highly enjoyable on a smaller scale than other Marvel movies.

Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly",The recurring theme of the importance of a father/daughter relationship is really touching.
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","For the sections of its 117-minute running time when it's focusing on its core plot, Ant-Man is a good time at the movies."
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","It's all so formulaic, so intentional, so transparently focused on a specific audience to milk a specific dollar."
Ant-Man,83%,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly","Paul Rudd brings a boyish charm to any role he plays. His ""Aw, shucks!"" demeanor is perfect for the film's version of Scott Lang, though this iteration of the character is also trapped in a story that can't decide what it wants him to be."

Avengers: Age of Ultron,76%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo",Whedon has tried to dazzle our eyes-and he does!- but has forgotten about engaging our brains.
Avengers: Age of Ultron,76%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo","The enemies are merely repetitive opportunities for over-the-top, realism-devoid, gravity-defying stunts and action sequences to play out, one after the next."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,76%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo",For the first time ....The Avengers were in Africa. CGI effects were well done and show how technology is advancing.

Avengers: Age of Ultron,76%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo","It's a funny, fantastic movie with the Avengers dealing with internal conflict (not least the fact that Tony and Banner basically created said enemy).

Avengers: Age of Ultron,76%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo","It's a sprawling epic that represents the best work the corporate Hollywood studio system can produce. With Whedon's work, that's not damning with faint praise, it's just a statement of fact."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,76%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo","Avengers: Age of Ultron is a big ol' action beat-'em-up between superheroes and robots.

Avengers: Endgame,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo","Films don't come any huger than this: the closing chapter to an 11-year saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, told across some 22 movies. And by the end of its three-hour runtime, there will definitely be tears."
Avengers: Endgame,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo",There really is very little that could be improved about Endgame. There's certainly no more that could be thrown at it.

Avengers: Endgame,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo","Feels like the end of the old cycle, the beginning of a reset. Old favourites gone, passing the mantle to others before they go. We even see a poster that reads, ""Where do we go, now that they're all gone?"""

Avengers: Endgame,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo","Terms like masterpiece and game-changer are often thrown around a bit hastily, but not on this occasion."

Avengers: Endgame,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo","""Avengers: Endgame"" was a wonderful surprise, filling almost every minute (all 181 of them) with excitement, drama, humor, and visually interesting and entertaining intrigue."
Avengers: Endgame,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo",What The Russo Brothers did here is take high expectations and blow them out of the water with an emotionally thrilling finale. Get ready to be moved!
Avengers: Endgame,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo",The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.
Avengers: Endgame,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo","Endgame is nothing short of a deserved send-off to the Infinity Saga, stamping an impressive mark on the cultural psyche. It has been one hell of a ride."
Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin",Episode 7: Globalism
Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin","Thanks to the superb visual effects, the film is truly a work of art, even if it tries to pack in just a little too much, making some characters more like afterthoughts rather than integral to the plot."
Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin","I'm torn on the big finale. This is either the gutsiest ending of any modern blockbuster, or a prelude to an emotional cop-out."
Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin","If you are remotely interested and if you remotely enjoyed the films of the MCU, this is a must watch. The Russo brothers have done it again."

Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin",Avengers: Infinity War is full of entertaining little parts that somehow do not make a compelling whole.

Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin","There's nothing new about Marvel's money-raking formula, but as each new chapter comes along, the serialized story becomes more and more unwieldy."
Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin",Josh Brolin does a fantastic job at bringing Thanos to life via motion capture without drowning under the motion capture.

Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin",Expect gasps at the haunting lack of closure. I dug the daring finale. It's every bit as entertaining as it is shocking and refreshing from a franchise that is predictable no more.
Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin","For most parts, Avengers: Infinity War largely works and has a lot to offer and take in, but it's not without sacrificial trade-offs and mixed emotions."
Avengers: Infinity War,85%,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin","Whenever it needs a moment of escalation, it can crank up the score, deliver a big hero money shot and then just allow a decade of storytelling to do the leg-work."

Black Panther,96%,"Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o","[It] showed not only was there audience appetite for a big-budget black superhero flick, but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism, oppression, and technological disparity."

Black Panther,96%,"Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o","A taut triumph of Afrofuturist iconography realized in the propulsive, widescreen language of the superhero-blockbuster fantasy, and an elevation of that genre on every front."

Black Panther,96%,"Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o",Here's the thing: you can enjoy Black Panther without having seen a single Marvel film beforehand. It is a stand-alone gem...

Black Panther,96%,"Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o","It's still somewhat overstuffed with an excess of characters and some undeniable hiccups in regards to pacing, but its filmmaking is slick, and the cast oozes charisma."
Black Panther,96%,"Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o","Black Panther is not just a superhero flick, it's a meaningful cultural hit that shows the power of diversity to tear down walls. [Full review in Spanish]"
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",A fabulous director and two awesome stars battle their way through a wonky script.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour","While it improves in the second half, Black Widow is too uneven and generic to recommend. Telling a story about freewill and liberation is ironically littered with too many artistic compromises."
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour","Fun, funny, and frenetic without being overwhelming. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour","Johansson is good, better than she's been given the opportunity to be before with this role, but she - like Black Widow is still stunted in many ways by the vision the MCU has for Natasha which makes this feel more elegiac than energetic."
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour","Marvel finally releases the Black Widow origin story, but how many more years before we see another one?"
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",Natasha deserved a better memorial.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",Bland spy hooey. Although Pugh is a standout.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour","Black Widow is worth seeing for Florence Pugh, the free-fall action sequence, and anything involving Taskmaster before it's revealed who is under the mask. The film mostly feels like it was done better by the films it was supposedly influenced by."
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",The rawness made for a spirited episode that every Marvel fan needs to listen to.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour","It would've been amazing to receive this movie 4 years ago, now it's just too late. That doesn't mean it's not a worthy closure for a much beloved character. [Full review in Spanish]"
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",The positives do outweigh the negatives but it does frustratingly end up feeling middle-of-the-road in terms of the MCU output.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",Black Widow is not as tedious and self-serious an entry as some of them. But that is setting the bar low.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",What ensues is a film that isn't interested in planting seeds for future Marvel movies -- which is actually a refreshing change of pace.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",Pugh is the only victory for this vanilla Marvel movie. [...] Fans are left wondering what could have been. And Johansson is left fighting a lawsuit against the world's biggest entertainment behemoth - a mission that seems too much even for Natasha.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",Black Widow achieves the unthinkable and dethrones Thor: The Dark World as the worst film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour","The spotlight should firmly be on her, or so you would have thought, but for all its acrobatic female kick-ass baddery poor old Natasha Romanoff has to share that limelight with her highly skilled ""family"" to bring down the patriarchy."
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour",Almost completely lacking in Black Widow is any sense of outrage over the grotesque violations of human rights and human dignity at the root of the whole premise of the film.
Black Widow,79%,"Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour","The problem with Black Widow is that the whole ordeal feels like an obligatory afterthought, simply going through the motions with only a perfunctory sense of charm."

Captain America: Civil War,90%,"Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson","In an era when superhero flicks hit theaters with the same frequency as bugs hit windshields, Captain America: Civil War still manages to rise above the fray and declare itself one of the finest pictures yet from Team Stan Lee."

Captain America: Civil War,90%,"Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson","On the surface, it's one superhero against another. Deep down, it's two friends being separated due to a difference in ideology."

Captain America: The First Avenger,80%,"Chris Evans, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan","Parents of comic book fans could do much, much worse."
Captain America: The First Avenger,80%,"Chris Evans, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan",Captain America is simply awful. It is another hour and a half of prologue to the film people are apparently waiting for The Avengers.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,90%,"Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson","This is a comic book movie so for all the high-minded subtext there are still big action scenes every ten minutes or so, each one larger and louder than the last."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,90%,"Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson","While the action sequences gain gravity and ferocity, the storyline reaches in the opposite direction with a tired world domination plot that's both stale and ludicrous."

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,90%,"Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson","An exciting film that expertly uses modern moviemaking techniques, yet relatively minimal CGI, to meld aspects of the best classic espionage thrillers of the '70s and the fast-paced action of the current superhero flicks."

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,90%,"Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson","Redford's still got it and Mackie shines, but this is Evans' show: melancholy, emotive and unfailingly heroic, he grounds the spectacle with humanity."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,90%,"Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson","With its suspense and political references that are important now more than ever,Captain America: The Winter Soldieris a thrilling addition to the Marvel canon."
Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn",There's some great visual humor. Once you get on Earth things start picking up.
Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn","Despite many redeeming qualities about Captain Marvel, I found it to be a very safe film with slightly heavy-handed elements, which wasn't very exciting."
Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn",This feels like a very by-committee MCU entry. At least they actually shoot in daylight at some honest-to-god recognizable locations in this one.

Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn","The chemistry between Larson and Lynch propels the last half of the movie; Lynch brings depth, love, and believability to Maria."
Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn","This nonlinear narrative adds interest beyond your typical origin story, but it's quickly overwhelmed by the same shtick that's in all these movies-uncompelling action sequences, recycled villains and flat direction."
Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn",The convoluted origin story mixed with the cluttered action sequences suck some of the air out of the theatre but their take on the superhero character as both an outsider and one of us is as refreshing as it is unusual.
Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn","A Marvel staple is to keep the story light and entertaining, and Captain Marvel is on par with Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man in that respect."
Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn","The production and release of Captain Marvel, the new science fiction superhero adventure from Marvel and Disney, has a number of remarkable features, but none of them involve the film's drama, action or characters."

Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn","Despite the standalone nature of this film, the first 40 minutes or so are fairly rough in design, structuring, and visuals."
Captain Marvel,79%,"Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn","This film pulls off the impressive feat of making an origin story interesting by upending the usual structure of these tales, throwing us headlong into the action with the title heroine and only then revealing how she became an intergalactic warrior."

Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams","Doctor Strange is a lesser-known figure in the Marvel universe and compared to films about the Avengers, Doctor Strange, as a film, comes out lesser, too."
Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams","Rote storytelling and pesky politics aside, the film does offer its rewards, particularly in Cumberbatch's fine performance, some twisty visuals (many cribbed from Inception), and the occasional dabs of gentle humor."
Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams","I'll leave it to others to make sense of the Marvel-y details in Doctor Strange, like Infinity Stones and other superhero cameos. But, as a stand-alone origin film, it more than fits the bill for blockbuster entertainment."
Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams","Something different, visually and thematically."
Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams","It isn't without flaws: some humorous moments feel shoehorned in and MacAdams is wasted in a disappointingly two-dimensional role.

Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams",Doctor Strange is a Marvel home run with a bat flip...
Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams",There's very little that Swinton can't do and she's absolutely sublime as The Ancient One.
Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams","The problem with Doctor Strange comes down to the narrative. As this is an origin story, it does take a while to get going. It's again a 'paint by the numbers' and formulaic storyline."
Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams","After getting a boatload of superhero stuff for years now, a 'fine movie' doesn't really warrant much of a reaction anymore."

Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams","Derrickson's bet is to turn the Supreme Sorcerer's origin film, created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, into a mind-blowing visual spectacle for the distinguished Benedict Cumberbatch to shine with the spell of his acting ability.

Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams",I wished I cared about what happened to the characters in this film... I didn't and I don't. Too bad.
Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams",Horrible dialogue throughout.
Doctor Strange,89%,"Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams","There is more than one way to tell an origin story, and Doctor Strange sets an excellent example by altering the mold, if not entirely breaking it."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","Eternals is Marvel's first attempt at making raw drama. The characters have depth, the score & visuals are unmatched, but I wished they'd committed to the genre change more"
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington",The film pushes back against the usual complaints offered up by those who harbor a performative disdain for Marvel's cinematic output.
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","Where Kubrick and Clarke took seriously the idea that human evolution may be prompted by alien intercession, Eternalsmakes the whole thing part of some gargantuan, intergalactic eugenics experiment wrapped in pop-philosophy and popcorn-authoritarianism."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","Eternals is deeply emotional and alters the Marvel formula we know, which some will love and some will hate."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington",It is entertaining and mostly fast-paced - until the interminable bombastic finale that goes on for many minutes longer than it should - and will please the MU fans.
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","Representation should be the headline-grabber for Eternals, but instead, the conversation around the film will likely focus on how much of a disappointment it is."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","The star-studded supergod origin story is all bland fight sequences, cold flashbacks, and blank faces taking in stunning vistas."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","It's the ambiguity, the attention to a person's capacity for contradiction and change, that sets Zhao's MCU debut apart..."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","This sounds kind of fun. And I wish it were. But with the exception of Kumail Nanjiani who offers, without question, the only real reason to see the movie, the story takes itself far too seriously for fun or, really, even logic."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","'Eternals' ventures into existential questions with welcome results for the MCU, however it shines more when the characters are a unit and not on their own side quests."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","A particular dud, and Marvel's worst in years. The mythology is ridiculous, the cast overstuffed, and the action unimpressive."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","Tropes be damned, Zhao carves out unexpectedly human immortals who actually care about each other. They love and hate and fight and forgive and feud and feel together. It's a refreshingly emotional take."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington",This is the first post-Endgame entry that I can happily call a great movie while seeing the franchise finally evolve in maturity and take bold risks in its storytelling.
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","If Eternals stuck to the multi-million dollar blueprint, it could have been one of the more fascinating MCU entries instead of the most disappointing effort to date."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","Such heady motivations, coupled with heroism, is a lovely core away from the usual costumed good vs. evil throwdowns, but it's very, very profuse, complete with all of the intergalactic gibberish in between."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","A Marvel epic that values personal connections over spectacle? Sorry adrenaline junkies, but that's what Oscar-winning, indie director Chloe Zhao brings to her first blockbuster. The result is uneven, but memorably inclusive and unique."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","In many ways Eternals is not a Chloe Zhao problem as much as it is an MCU problem. After the lights came back on my first thought was that this is where comic book movies have ""jumped the shark""."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","Certainly a revamp, even if it doesn't prove to be a particularly refreshing one."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","In the end, the movie was reliably entertaining as, generally speaking, the MCU is... [But] the concept of Eternals is a lot more interesting than the execution of Eternals."
Eternals,60%,"Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington","It's ugly, charisma-free, dour, overlong, exposition-heavy, patronizing, and, worst of all, it has none of the heart even feinted at by the least successful films within the MCU canon."

Guardians of the Galaxy,92%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista","Gunn knows not to take the material too seriously, that a fun space adventure such as this should be exactly that: fun and adventurous."
Guardians of the Galaxy,92%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista",Guardians of the Galaxy is great reminder that not all superhero comic book films have to be dark and moody.
Guardians of the Galaxy,92%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista","Combining huge, spectacle-scale special effects, giant practical sets, and a massive scale, Guardians also works on a narrative level, and as the story of strange, unique, very human-even when they're not-characters."

Guardians of the Galaxy,92%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista","James Gunn has taken a group of characters that the majority didn't care about two years ago and made them guaranteed fan favourites in a movie that's not only one of the most awesome Marvel movies yet, but also 2014's best."
Guardians of the Galaxy,92%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista","Very entertaining from the great actor selection, to the special effects, to the plot scheme."
Guardians of the Galaxy,92%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista","The film marked Marvel Studios going full-on Marvel Comics, bringing with it the requisite band of multi-coloured misfits, whose intersecting character arcs - while occasionally incomplete - formed an alluring tapestry."

Guardians of the Galaxy,92%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista","If Boyhood is a reminder of film's potential to be groundbreaking art, Guardians of the Galaxy is a testament to its capacity for inducing pure joy."

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper","The jokey demeanor that informed the first film remains, even if writer-director James Gunn forces too many gags. But the freshness of the characters remains intact, and the actors continue to interact in a manner that supports the narrative spine."

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper",Some can argue that the surprise factor has gone...The first film was a feel good exercise involving infinity stones with a sing-a-long and toe-tapping soundtrack. But the sequel felt like an overcooked and bloated indulgence.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper","By the final-act showdown with a much larger threat, you may find yourself inadvertently tearing up. Family can be tough, but then, love usually is."

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper","In the end, it isn't about whether it's a better movie than the first installment; like most of the characters within, it's more mature and substantial and doesn't rely on past accomplishments to make it great."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,85%,"Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper","There are still familiar elements, like the early-80's pop tunes that add to the exuberance of the film; overall the film has a vibrant joy that's infectious.

Iron Man,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow","Iron Man might feature a mesmerizing performance by Robert Downey Jr. and kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but that doesn't entirely save it from a weak villain or falling apart by the third act."

Iron Man,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow","Few of the films in the (MCU) are as accessible as this one, and while you may not love it in your top-ten films of all-time, you can't beat the good time this film brings."

Iron Man,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow","It's faithful to the comic origins without being slavish, draws ideas from the entire run of the series, and stirs a self-aware sense of humor through the action while still taking the enterprise seriously."
Iron Man,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow","His well-honed acting chops aside, a big reason the casting of Downey as Stark works so darn well is that incorrigible streak, which he somehow always has been able to balance with an irrepressible likability and which he uses to full effect here."
Iron Man,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow","Injecting the brilliantly bright, quick, and clever life force that is Robert Downey Jr. into the comic-book superhero realm is a masterstroke, a kick in the head to the tired franchises of the genre."
Iron Man,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow","Led by Downey's career-resurrecting performance as billionaire weapons peddler Tony Stark, it proves just as indispensable to the movie's giddy escapist appeal as the seamless CGI effects and eye-popping pyrotechnics."
Iron Man,94%,"Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow",Downey updates the superhero prototype with a unique blend of bravado and wit.
Iron Man 2,72%,"Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle",The finale still stands as one of the best and most exciting of the MCU.
Iron Man 2,72%,"Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle","Rumours had been circulating around Iron Man 2 for some time - rumours of re-shoots and studio cuts. Is this what they wanted, you wonder? Or is this what they were trying to avoid?"
Iron Man 2,72%,"Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle","Doesn't quite stand up to the original, but comes close. The lead villain and the final showdown leaves this film feeling a little empty. Still more than worth a watch though."

Iron Man 2,72%,"Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle","There's some nice character work here.

Iron Man 2,72%,"Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle","Iron Man 2 would be surpassed by some other offerings in the MCU, notably the first two Captain America movies, but it remains one of the smartest and least silly chapters in the 22-film extravaganza."

Iron Man 3,79%,"Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle","Iron Man 3 is pure Iron Man fun in the style we've become accustomed to. Downey, Jr. keeps up the charm, even through all of his snarky comments, while bringing a depth to the scenes concerning his post-Avengers PTSD."
