# Week 3 - ggplot - Homewok

> For all the below tasks, use the data that you were working on during the class.

## Task 1

1. Plot a histogram of one of your continuous variables
2. Set either the number of bins or binwidth to something that makes sense
3. Use a red dashed line to show the mean value of the variable on the histogram
4. Give a title to your plot
5. Add X, Y axis labs

## Task 2

1. Create a scatterplot
2. Use the `position = 'jitter'` parameter in `geom_point` and understand what it does (we didn't cover this in the class but don't worry it's not too difficult)
3. Pro tip: There is an easier way to do this. Just use `geom_jitter()` instead of `geom_point()`
4. Add a linear regression line to your plot
5. Zoom in on the plot

## Task 3

1. Wrap Task 2's plot in a function that both saves and shows the plot in RStudio.

## Task 4 (Optional, won't be graded)

1. Either use `geom_bin2d()` / `stat_bin_2d()` (not covered in class)
2. OR use any of the `stat_*` functions.
3. For both of the above, I recommend taking a look at this link: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

## Good luck!
