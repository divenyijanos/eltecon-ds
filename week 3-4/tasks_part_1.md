# Tasks for 2020-09-23, Part 1

> You can do the following exercises using the data you have already chosen. Make sure to save your work (the code) b/c you will use it in Part 2 and will also need to send it to me alongside your homework! (It won't be graded but I want to see what's going more and what's going less well.)

1. Plot a histogram of one of the key variables!

    1. Set the bar's color to blue
    1. Set a different bin width (I didn't cover this, search the documentation if needed)   

1. Use the `geom_col()` function to plot the frequency of a variable!
    
    1. Frequency = number of observations per variable

1. Replicate the above plot using `geom_bar()`

1. Search for and use a plot type that we haven't before!

1. Show the connection between two of your variables!

    1. Which plot is best for doing this?
    1. Add a straight line to your plot where y = 0
    1. Add transparency to the dots
    1. Bring in a 3rd variable using coloring
    1. Now, replace coloring with faceting
