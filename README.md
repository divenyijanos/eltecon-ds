# ELTECON DS course

This repo was created for the Geographical economics (Data Science) course on ELTE.

## Prerequisites

To take this course you should have basic knowledge about R, RStudio and Git.

Make sure you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed.

We have provided some examples and tasks, which you should be able to do by the start of the course and indicates the level of knowledge you will need, so you won't be lost during the classes. At the end of each task there are some additional resources provided about the topic, but feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

If you know how to use Git, you can clone this project and go through the examples and tasks provided under the *prerequisite folder*.

If you have not used Git before, press the `Clone or download` button, then select `Download ZIP`. After unzipping the downloaded file you can start the tasks in the prerequisite folder (probably it is the best to start with learning about `git`.)

All the tasks are provided in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) and in HTML (generated by RMarkdown). You can either Knit the RMarkdown document or drag and drop the HTML file into your web browser.
