# ELTECON Data Science course

## Prerequisites

To take this course you should have basic knowledge about R, RStudio and Git.

Make sure you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed.

We have provided some examples and tasks, which you should be able to do by the start of the course and which indicate the level of knowledge you will need not to be lost during the classes. At the end of each task, there are some additional resources provided about each topic, but feel free to reach out if you have any questions (write to eltecon.ds gmail address)!

If you know how to use Git, you can clone this project and go through the examples and tasks provided under the *prerequisite folder*.

If you have not used Git before, press the `Clone or download` button, then select `Download ZIP`. After unzipping the downloaded file you can start the tasks in the prerequisite folder (it contains a small tutorial on git as well).

All the tasks are provided in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) and in HTML (generated by RMarkdown). You can either Knit the RMarkdown document or drag and drop the HTML file into your web browser.
