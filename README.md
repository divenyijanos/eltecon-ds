# Data Science (aka Regional economics)

The aim of the course is to provide a detailed introduction into the modern data science. Building upon basic knowledge in statistics, real data and actual business applications we cover the tools that are elemental in our day-to-day work as data scientists. The course is practice-oriented: students will work on their own data science projects throughout the course where they can apply the methods they learn.

The course materials can be accessed in the [course's GitHub page](https://github.com/divenyijanos/eltecon-ds).

# Format

The course consists of 13 weekly sessions of 2x90 minutes. Each session is going to include a shorter theoretical part and a longer practice-oriented part. Each session is held by an instructor while a co-instructor assists students in case of individual problems.

# Instructors

András Bérczi, János Divényi, Zsuzsa Holler, Tamás Koncz, Levente Otti and Sándor Sóvágó - members of the data science team of [Emarsys](https://www.emarsys.com/)

Office hours: every Friday (you should book a slot until the previous Wednesday [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yu6GqyeyuzwHlKFf8o-1Zi2VCxJiO5LHpzu8YMZhb4Q/edit?usp=sharing))

# Prerequisite

The course expects basic knowledge of the programming language `R` and the corresponding application `RStudio`. To refresh this knowledge, we collected supplementary materials into the "prerequisite" folder. This knowledge is necessary to successfully complete the course.

First, install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your local machine. There are 4 topics in the prerequisite folder: R introduction, functions, data.table (for data manipulation), ggplot (for data visualization). Each topic contains a description, some sample exercises and references for further studies. The sample exercises show the level we expect throughout the course. To ensure that we are on the same page, we are going to spend some time on refreshing this knowledge in the first few weeks.

You can get the material by clicking on the button `Code` and chosing the option `Download ZIP`. After extracting, you can browse the files. Each file has two versions: you can open the `html` files in your browser and view them, or you can open the `.Rmd` files in Rstudio and interact with the material (e.g. run code chunks).

# Evaluation

The final grade consists of two parts: weekly homeworks (50%) and the final project (50%). The students work on the tasks in pairs. The homeworks aim to help the final project. The final project is to be presented in a separate session, held on the 15th of December. For more detail about the final project see its own description.
