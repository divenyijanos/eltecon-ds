# Final project description

<br>

**Come up with and answer a research question (or hypothesis) related to the dataset that you've picked and worked with throughout the course.**

You can answer the research question using any method you seem fit, but usually we expect students to work with what we taught them and either use

-  descriptive analysis
-  and/or predictive analysis.

**The ultimate goal of the final project is to assess how well you can combine and use the tools for data analysis that you've learned this semester.**

The project consists of (and will be evaluated upon) two parts: a written document answering the research question and a live presentation.

For this project, we ask you to keep working with your homework partner.

## What's a good research question?

A good research question is...

- simple
- interesting (at least you can convince us that it is)
- relevant in some business context

### Examples

- What are the most important predictors of Budapest flat prices? (This question is actually related to one of the datasets)
    + This question is straightforward (simple)
    + Finding the answer has business value. For example with the answer you could help people decide on their house's price when they would like to sell it.
- Who were the top 3 most successful football players in the past 5 years? (This question is not related to any of the provided datasets. Our football dataset is on team level, and not on player.)
    + Interesting to football fans
    + You'd need to define metrics for success, which is an important task for data scientists
    + This can be answered using descriptive stats only

## Steps to finish your project on time

We understand that it's difficult to start working on a project earlier than you must. Try to do your future homeworks in a way that will help you in your final project. That requires that you at least start thinking about your research question ASAP.

Consult with us regularly! We will have dedicated sessions and homeworks for that but it's up to you to start working on the project early and coming to the consultation sessions.

We will help you by consulting about your project's status at these milestones:

1. You figure out your research question / hypothesis (will be part of the **October 14th** class' homework)
2. You have a high level outline of how you mean to answer the question (will be part of the **November 4th** class' homework)

### Timeline for consultations

- 3 consultations (you can book a 15 min slot later for the last 30 minutes of each class). On these dates you can consult about anything related to your final project, may that be the research question, methods, structure or anything else.
    + **November 18th** *(Wednesday)*
    + **November 25th** *(Wednesday)*
    + **December 2nd** *(Wednesday)*
- **December 4th** *(Friday)*: You will hand in your your written project.
- **December 9th** *(Wednesday)*: This class will be mostly about giving you feedback on your written projects.
- **December 11th** *(Friday)*: You can re-submit your written project based on our feedback. Note, that this is not compulsory and you can only get 15% (out of the total) additional points.
- **December 16th** *(Wednesday)*: Final project's live presentation. Even if you decided not to re-submit your the written part, you'll need to address our feedback/questions during your presentation.

## What are we looking for in your project?

We are looking for a well-structured and intelligent deduction using the tools that you've learned during the course.

Well-structured means that your analysis has clearly separated parts, each with its own objective. For example, an introduction where you state your research question, then, a part where you introduce your data, then your chosen method, etc.

Intelligent means that you don't just include a histogram in your descriptive analysis part because you've seen it during a class. You may include a histogram as a tool to answer a sub-question that will help you answer your research question. For example: “I want to use variable X in my regression analysis. Outliers can have a misleading effect on the slope. Are there outliers in this variable?” Then, it would make sense to use the histogram.

A thorough research paper could be very-very long if it tries to cover each and every detail around the question. We don't expect that from you. But what we expect is that you mention important details that you won't deal with and highlight shortcuts that you take (and why you take them). For example: you have missing data in your dataset. It's OK to drop these lines when fitting a linear regression on your data as long as you convince us that this is an efficient solution because it would take too much time to collect this data and that it wouldn’t bias your results anyways.

Also, it's OK not dealing with certain edge cases, saying they are out of scope as long as you mention them and we know that you thought about them. For example if you'd try to predict whether a football player will score during a game you could take out self-goals from the equation for simplification as long as you mention that.

We don't expect your answer to the research question to be ground breaking. Stating a hypothesis and finding out that it's wrong is equally good as finding it's opposite as long as your methods are correct.

## Technical requirements

### Written part

**Length**: Not limited but usually between 3-5 pages   
**Output**:
