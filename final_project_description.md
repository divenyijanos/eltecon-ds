# Final project description

**For this final project, your task will be to come up with and answer a research question (or hypothesis) related to the dataset that you've picked and worked with throughout the course.**

You can answer the research question with any tools you seem fit, but usually we expect students to work with what we taught them and either use

-  descriptive analysis
-  and/or predictive analysis.

**The ultimate goal of the final project is to assess how well can you combine and use the tools for data analysis that you've learned this semester.**

The project consists of (and will be evaluated upon) two parts: a written document answering the research question and a live presentation.

For this project, we ask you to keep working with your home work partner.

## What's a good research question?

A good research question is...

- simple
- interesting (at least to someone)
- may have business value in answering it

### Examples

- What are the most important predictors of Budapest flat prices?
    + This question is straightforward (simple)
    + Finding the answer has business value. For example with the answer you could help people evaluate their house price when they would like to sell it.
- Who were the top 3 most successful football players in the past 5 years
    + Interesting to football fans
    + You'd need to define metrics for success, which is in important task for data scientists
    + This can be answered using descriptive stats only

## What are we looking for in your project?

We are looking for a well structured and intelligent deduction using the tools that you've learned during the course.

Well structured means that your analysis has clearly separated parts, each with its own objective. For example, an introduction where you state your research question, then, a part where we get to know your data, then descriptive statistics, etc.

Intelligent means that you don't just include a histogram in your descriptive analysis part because you've seen it during a class. You may include a histogram as a tool to answer a sub-question that will help you answer your research question. For example: I want to use variable X in my regression analysis. Outliers can have a misleading effect on the slope. Are there outliers in this variable? And now it would makes sense to use the histogram.

A thorough research paper can be very-very long when it tries to cover each and every detail around the question. We don't expect that from you. But what we expect is that you at least mention important details that you won't deal with and highlight shortcuts that you take (and why you take them). For example: you have missing data in your dataset. It's OK to drop these line when fitting a linear regression on your data as long as you tell us that you think that this is the most efficient solution because it would take too much time to collect this data and you still have enough data anyways.

Also, it's OK not dealing with certain edge cases, saying they are out of scope as long as you mention them and we know that you thought about them. For example if you'd try to predict weather a football player will score during a game you could take out self-goals from the equation for simplification as long as you mention that.

We don't expect your answer to the research question to be ground breaking. Stating a hypothesis and finding out that it's wrong is equally good as finding it's opposite as long as your methods are correct.

A common mistake is when students try to fit into the project as many plots and analysis as possible but without good reason. We are looking for using these tools only where and when necessary, aiming for simplicity.

## Consult with us

One way to avoid the above mentioned mistake is to consult with us regularly. We will have dedicated sessions for that but it's up to you to start working on the project early and coming to the consultation sessions.

### Steps to finish your project on time

We understand that it's difficult to start working on a project earlier than you must. Try to do your future homeworks in a way that will help you in your final project. That requires that you at least start thinking about your research question ASAP.

We will help you by consulting about the your project's status at these milestones:

1. You figures out your research question / hypothesis 
2. You have a high level outline of how you mean to answer the question

Once you've completed the project, we'll give you feedback. You can't change your written project at this point but it will help you to prepare for your presentation.

## Technical requirements

**Length**: Not limited but usually between 3-5 pages   
**Output**:

- PDF, 12p font size, 1.5 line spacing
- You should also attach any code that you used to produce your document
- Presentation: either in PDF or in pptx

## Grading

- 35% homeworks
- 35% final project (written)
- 25% presentation
- 5% code for the final project (we greade readability and structure)
(code is also evaluated but should not be included in the document)
