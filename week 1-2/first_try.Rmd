## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## A sample analysis

We are going to use two packages regularly: `data.table` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for data visualization. The package `magrittr` provides the handy pipe operator `%>%` to chain lines of code.

Here is a simple example:

```{r data.table}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)

mtcars %>%
    setDT() %>%
    .[, .(mean_mpg = mean(mpg)), by = cyl] %>%
    ggplot(aes(factor(cyl), mean_mpg)) + 
    geom_col() +
    labs(x = "Number of cylinders", y = "Avg fuel consumption (Miles/gallon)")
```
