# R and RStudio
- R is a programming language

- RStudio is an IDE for using R
    - IDE: Integrated Development Environment
    - Code editor
    - Built-in automation tools

- R may be used without RStudio, but RStudio cannot be used without R

## RStudio projects
- RStudio projects help to organize your work

- Each project has its own working directory and workspace

- You can work in multiple projects at the same time

## Relative paths
- Check your working directory with ``getwd()``, it might return ``"/Users/your_name"``

- If you need, set your working directory with ``setwd()``
    - e.g. ``setwd("~/eltecon-ds/first_class")``

- When you refer to a file in the working directory, don't need to specify the path
    - ``foo <- fread("sales.csv")``

- but, when you refer to a file in another directory, you need to define the path relative to the working directory
    - ``foo <- fread("data/sales.csv")``
    - ``foo <- fread("../sales.csv")``

# Annoying situations

## Code calls files that are not available anymore
``
Error in fread("data/raw_data.csv"): File 'data/raw_data.csv' does not exist or is non-readable.
``

## Don't understand what is happening in the code you wrote last year
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dt <- fread("data/data.csv")
boo <- foo(dt)
out1 <- doCalculations(boo)
out2 <- doMoreCalculations(boo)
plotFigures(boo)
plotMoreDetailedFigures(boo)
```

## Have to change one of your assuptions in your model that was copy pasted throughout the whole project
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/copy_paste.png')
```

# Code and data - Guidelines
## A good directory structure
- project_directory
    - analysis.R
    - functions.R
    - data
    - figures
    - README.md

## analysis.R
- Save your analysis script here

- Write comments to separate sections, but do not overuse them

- Use intention revealing names
    - e.g. instead of ``ps`` use ``product_supply``

- Make meaningful distinctions
    - e.g. don't use ``cust`` and ``customers`` close to each other

- Use pronounceable names
    - e.g. instead of ``purchymd`` use ``purchase_date``

- Use uppercase letters for constants
    - e.g. ``PROPORTION_OF_INCOME_SAVED``, ``LEVEL_OF_UTILITY``

## functions.R
- Save your functions here

- Functions in long scopes should have short evocative names
    - e.g. ``replaceNAWithZero()``

- Functions in small scopes should have long and precise names
    - e.g. ``plotPriceElasticityOfGasolineDemand()``

## Clean coding
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/uncle_bob.jpg')
```

*"You shouldn't have to read the body of a function to know what it does. It's name should tell you."* - Robert Cecil Martin aka Uncle Bob

## data folder
- File names should declare their function

- Always keep a version of the original raw data

- Optionally, use sub-folders in the data folder like
    - raw_data
    - processed_data
