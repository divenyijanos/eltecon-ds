# RStudio project setup practice
1. Create a Github account if you do not have one already
2. Create a new public Github repository (name it eltecon-ds-class)
3. Create a new RStudio project with Version Control (clone your new repository from Github)
    - If you are using Windows git needs to be downloaded to your PC
4. Your should make at least 2 commits throughout your work
5. Add the word 'data' to your .gitignore file
6. Create a directory in your project's working directory named 'data' and copy the sales.csv file into it
7. Install data.table and ggplot2 packages if not installed yet (use the ``install.packages()`` function), and load them in (use the ``library()`` function)
8. Create a file named analysis.R and write a short script in it that creates a simple chart using the sales.csv data
9. Update the README.md with a short description of your project
10. Push your working code to the remote repository
    - Note: You might need to set the email address you used on Github to be able to push by typing ``git config --global user.email "YOUREMAILADDRESS@example.com"`` in command line
11. Send your name and your repository's url to eltecon.ds kukac gmail pont com
